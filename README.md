# VBA-challenge

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze stock market data using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripting in Excel. The script loops through stock data for each quarter and calculates the following:

* Ticker Symbol: The unique identifier for each stock.
* Quarterly Change: The difference between the opening price at the beginning of the quarter and the closing price at the end of the quarter.
* Percentage Change: The percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.
* Total Stock Volume: The sum of the volume of stock traded during the quarter.

Additionally, the script identifies and outputs:

* The stock with the greatest percentage increase.
* The stock with the greatest percentage decrease.
* The stock with the greatest total volume.

The script also applies conditional formatting:

* Green for positive changes.
* Red for negative changes.
* No color for zero values.
